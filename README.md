# Coursera Project  
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

### mtcar dataset: 

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

____
## Part1: Shiny Application  
> 
1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

____
## Part2: Reproducible Pitch Presentation  
> OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify with an html5 slide deck.

> **Here's what you need**  
* 5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify
* Your presentation pushed to github
* A link to your github presentation pasted into the text box below

> **Your presentation must satisfy the following**  
* It must be done in Slidify
* It must be 5 pages
* It must be on github
* It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document
